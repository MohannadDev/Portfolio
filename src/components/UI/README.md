## HoverText

`HoverText` is an interactive text component that changes color when you hover over it. It offers different animation patterns for the color change.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Component Structure:**
   ```tsx
   interface HoverTextProps {
     text: string;
     className?: string;
     baseColor?: string; 
     hoverColor?: string;
     variant?: "left-to-right" | "center-outward" | "random" | "from-cursor";
     duration?: number;
     resetDelay?: number;
   }
   ```

2. **State Management:**
   - `isHovered`: Tracks whether the text is currently being hovered
   - `letters`: Array of individual characters from the input text
   - `letterColors`: Array tracking the current color of each letter
   - `hoveredLetterIndex`: Tracks which letter the cursor is hovering over
   - `animationComplete`: Indicates when the animation has finished
   - The component uses multiple refs to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders

3. **Animation Variants:**
   - **left-to-right:** Color change moves sequentially from the first letter to the last
   - **center-outward:** Colors spread from the middle letter to both edges simultaneously
   - **random:** Letters change color in a randomized order (shuffled using Fisher-Yates algorithm)
   - **from-cursor:** Animation starts precisely at the letter under your cursor and radiates outward

4. **Cursor Detection:**
   The component uses multiple strategies to accurately detect which letter is under the cursor:
   - Direct hit testing using `document.elementFromPoint()`
   - Bounding box intersection testing
   - Weighted Euclidean distance calculation (prioritizing horizontal position)
   - Movement threshold detection to prevent "jitter"

5. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Debounced mouse movement handling (5ms)
   - Distance threshold to skip processing small movements
   - Animation state tracking with refs
   - Prevents interrupting animations in progress

6. **Core Functions:**
   - `handleMouseEnter`: Initializes the animation when hovering begins
   - `handleMouseMove`: Tracks cursor position and updates the animation start point
   - `findHoveredLetterIndex`: Complex algorithm to accurately identify the hovered letter
   - `findNearestLetterIndex`: Fallback method using distance calculation
   - `animateLetters`: Controls the timing and sequence of color changes
   - `getAnimationSequence`: Determines the order in which letters change color

### Usage Example:
```tsx
<HoverText
  text="Hover over me"
  variant="from-cursor"
  baseColor="#929292"
  hoverColor="#ffffff"
  duration={0.2}
  resetDelay={1500}
/>
```

## SplitText

`SplitText` breaks text into individual letters to create entrance animations. It's perfect for titles and important text that should grab attention.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Component Structure:**
   ```tsx
   interface SplitTextProps {
     text?: string;
     className?: string;
     delay?: number;
     animationFrom?: { opacity: number; transform: string };
     animationTo?: { opacity: number; transform: string };
     easing?: keyof typeof easings;
     threshold?: number;
     rootMargin?: string;
     textAlign?: "left" | "right" | "center" | "justify" | "initial" | "inherit";
     onLetterAnimationComplete?: () => void;
   }
   ```

2. **Text Processing:**
   - The component parses input text into a nested structure:
     - First, splits the text into words: `text.split(" ")`
     - Then, splits each word into individual letters: `words.map((w) => w.split(""))`
   - This structure preserves proper spacing between words

3. **Intersection Observer Implementation:**
   - Uses the Intersection Observer API to detect when the component enters the viewport
   - The animation only triggers when the text becomes visible to the user
   - Configurable threshold and root margin allow fine-tuning of when the animation starts

4. **Animation System:**
   - Each letter receives its own CSS transition with staggered delay
   - The delay is calculated as: `index * delay` milliseconds
   - Customizable easing functions using CSS cubic-bezier curves
   - Both starting and ending animation states can be fully configured
   - Transitions control opacity and transform properties simultaneously

5. **Technical Details:**
   - Uses `will-change: transform, opacity` to optimize performance
   - Preserves whitespace with special handling
   - Prevents layout shifts with careful width calculations
   - Provides callback function for animation completion

### Usage Example:
```tsx
<SplitText
  text="Hello World!"
  delay={50}
  animationFrom={{ opacity: 0, transform: "translateY(20px)" }}
  animationTo={{ opacity: 1, transform: "translateY(0)" }}
  easing="easeOutQuint"
  className="text-4xl font-bold"
/>
```

## ClickSpark

`ClickSpark` adds a fun sparkle effect whenever a user clicks anywhere on the wrapped element.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Component Structure:**
   ```tsx
   interface ClickSparkProps {
     sparkColor?: string;
     sparkSize?: number;
     sparkRadius?: number;
     sparkCount?: number;
     duration?: number;
     easing?: "linear" | "ease-in" | "ease-out" | "ease-in-out";
     extraScale?: number;
     children?: React.ReactNode;
   }
   ```

2. **Canvas-Based Rendering:**
   - Uses HTML Canvas API for high-performance rendering
   - Creates an overlay canvas that captures clicks and renders sparks
   - Automatically resizes with the parent element using ResizeObserver

3. **Spark Generation and Physics:**
   - Each spark is defined by: position, angle, and start time
   - Sparks are arranged in a circular pattern around the click point
   - Each spark animates outward with fading opacity
   - Custom easing functions control the animation curve

4. **Animation Loop:**
   - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth, efficient animation
   - Calculates each spark's position based on elapsed time
   - Clears and redraws the canvas on every frame
   - Automatically removes sparks after their animation completes

5. **Optimization Techniques:**
   - Canvas clearing and redrawing only when necessary
   - Efficient data structures for tracking spark state
   - Debounced resize handling to prevent performance issues
   - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Usage Example:
```tsx
<ClickSpark
  sparkColor="#ffcc00"
  sparkSize={8}
  sparkRadius={20}
  sparkCount={12}
  duration={500}
>
  <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">
    Click me for sparkles!
  </button>
</ClickSpark>
```

## AnimatedText

`AnimatedText` creates dynamic text animations using Framer Motion for smooth, physics-based motion.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Component Structure:**
   ```tsx
   interface AnimatedTextProps {
     text: string;
     className?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Framer Motion Integration:**
   - Uses Framer Motion's variant system for clean animation definitions
   - Defines container and child variants with appropriate relationships
   - Implements staggered animations for natural word-by-word reveal

3. **Animation Configuration:**
   - Employs spring physics for natural motion
   - Customizable damping and stiffness values
   - Staggered children with configurable delay between words

4. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Each word is wrapped in its own motion component
   - Container orchestrates the timing of children animations
   - Maintains proper text alignment and spacing

### Usage Example:
```tsx
<AnimatedText
  text="This text will animate word by word"
  className="text-2xl font-bold"
/>
```

## StarBorder

`StarBorder` creates a decorative, animated border with star-like elements that move along the edges of the container.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Component Structure:**
   ```tsx
   type StarBorderProps<T extends React.ElementType> = 
     React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T> & {
       as?: T;
       className?: string;
       children?: React.ReactNode;
       color?: string;
       speed?: React.CSSProperties['animationDuration'];
     }
   ```

2. **Polymorphic Component Design:**
   - Uses TypeScript generics to allow rendering as any HTML element
   - Preserves proper type safety for props
   - Defaults to `button` but can be any valid element type

3. **Animation Implementation:**
   - Creates two animated layers for top and bottom borders
   - Uses CSS keyframe animations defined in the theme
   - Implements radial gradients for the star effect
   - Precisely positions elements using absolute positioning

4. **Styling Details:**
   - Custom rounded corners for a polished look
   - Background gradient for the content container
   - Z-index management to ensure proper layering
   - Configurable colors and animation speeds

### Usage Example:
```tsx
<StarBorder
  as="div"
  color="#ffcc00"
  speed="8s"
  className="w-64"
>
  Content inside a star-bordered container
</StarBorder>
```

## ShinyText

`ShinyText` creates text with a shimmering, reflective effect that moves across the letters.

### Implementation Details:

1. **Component Structure:**
   ```tsx
   interface ShinyTextProps {
     text: string;
     disabled?: boolean;
     speed?: number;
     className?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **CSS Animation Technique:**
   - Uses CSS linear gradients with transparent and white sections
   - Animates the background position to create movement
   - Applies text as a clip mask with `background-clip: text`
   - Controls animation speed with the `speed` prop

3. **Technical Details:**
   - Inline styles for dynamic configuration
   - Compatible with Tailwind CSS classes
   - Optimized for performance with minimal DOM elements
   - Can be disabled for conditional rendering

### Usage Example:
```tsx
<ShinyText
  text="Shimmering text effect"
  speed={3}
  className="text-2xl font-bold"
/>
```
